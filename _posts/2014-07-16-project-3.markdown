description: >
  Jungle Game is a digital adaptation of Dou Shou Qi (“Fighting Beast Chess”) on a 7×9 animal-themed board. Built in Java with a clear MVC structure (controller, view, model), it offers three interfaces—welcome screen, user manual, and game board—with bilingual prompts, real-time status updates, and precise error hints. The API separates Location/Board and Piece/Player classes, supported by UML and sequence diagrams for maintainable, test-driven development.
