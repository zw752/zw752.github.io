description: >
  C-RAF 2.0 is an AI-driven RegTech platform that streamlines Hong Kong financial compliance by ingesting unstructured data (PDFs, minutes, recordings), applying embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002, BERT), and indexing in FAISS for rapid similarity search and Q&A. Its three-step framework—Inherent Risk Assessment, Cyber Maturity Assessment, and Intelligence-led Attack Simulation—coupled with a customizable UI, empowers compliance teams and regulators to query and retrieve evidence-based insights on demand.
