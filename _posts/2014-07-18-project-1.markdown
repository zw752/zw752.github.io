description: >
  This project delivers an AI-powered RegTech solution designed to streamline regulatory compliance for Hong Kong’s financial 
  sector. Leveraging unstructured data ingestion (PDFs, meeting minutes, recordings) and advanced embedding models (text-embedding- 
  ada-002, BERT), our pipeline splits documents into “chunks,” cleanses and masks sensitive elements, then indexes them in a FAISS 
  vector database for lightning-fast similarity search and Q&A. Through a three-step framework—Inherent Risk Assessment, Cyber 
  Maturity Assessment, and Intelligence-led Attack Simulation—users can gauge risk levels, evaluate cybersecurity maturity across 
  seven domains, and test defenses via simulated attacks. A customizable UI portal enables regulators, auditors, and in-house 
  compliance teams to query natural language prompts (e.g., “Inherent Risk: Product & Technology”) and retrieve evidence-backed 
  insights.
