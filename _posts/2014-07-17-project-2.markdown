description: >
We build a data product for topic modeling and classification on “A Million News Headlines”. After preprocessing 1.19 M headlines (deduplication, stemming, stop-word removal), we apply LSA, LDA, T5 + Clustering, Top2Vec, BERTopic, and H5 + Clustering, visualizing with t-SNE and word clouds. For classification, Auto-Encoder and BERT distinguish positive vs. negative headlines. Models are compared via coherence, diversity, and human evaluation.
