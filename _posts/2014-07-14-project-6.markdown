description: >
  We implement a Python-based social media management system supporting user registration, authentication, friendship, and article posting with source, anchor, and report relationships. Utilizing OOP (User and Article classes), data abstractions (lists, dictionaries, tuples), and Breadth-First Search, it computes article influence and identifies Key Opinion Leaders via getInfluence, getKOLs, and isKOL. The modular, scalable architecture promotes reusable, testable, and efficient code.
