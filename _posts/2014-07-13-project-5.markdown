  Innotar is a blockchain-based notarization platform built on Hyperledger Fabric and IPFS to secure digital documents. Users upload files, which get hashed and timestamped; smart contracts automate certificate issuance and access control. The system offers immutable, decentralized storage, fast low-cost verification, and user-centric interface design. Innotar aims to complement existing notary services, reducing labor costs while ensuring confidentiality and traceability.
